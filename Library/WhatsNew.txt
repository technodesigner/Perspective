What's new in Perspective library ?

What's new in version 2.1.0.1 : 
- Perspective 3D models may now be exported in STL (STereoLithography) files. 
This enable 3D printing (tested for MakerBot Replicator 2X and MakerWare).
Thanks to the makespace.org community in Cambridge (UK) for their help, in particular Kim Spence-Jones and Nicholas Johnson
- New class SltEncoder (Perspective.Wpf3D.Export)
- New shape House3D and new demo page House3D+Export
- GeometryElement3D.Sculptor is now public
- Environment : Visual Studio Ultimate 2013 Preview, Windows 8.1 Pro Preview, .NET 4, MakerBot Replicator 2X and MakerWare

What's new since version 2.0 beta :
- BREAKING CHANGE : Namespace change from Perspective.Core.Primitives to Perspective.Core.Wpf : AxisDirection, Helper3D
- Perspective.Core.Wpf
RenderingHelper : new property IsHWAccelerationDisabled, which enables to turn off/on global hardware acceleration. New method SetHwndHWAcceleration to to turn off/on hardware acceleration for a window.
GeometryHelper : new methods GetRotationMatrix, GetTranslationMatrix, GetScaleMatrix, GetSkewMatrix and RotatePoint
Helper3D : new methods GetScaleMatrix, GetTranslationMatrix, GetXRotationMatrix, GetYRotationMatrix, GetZRotationMatrix
- Perspective.Hosting
Extension : new property SortOrder, AssemblyName abstract property moved to ItemBase
- Perspective.Wpf3D.Shapes
XyzAxis3D : new property CoordinateSystemKind (to display right-handed or left-handed coordinate systems)
- New icons color
- BREAKING CHANGE : SignalCommand.Executing event renamed as SignalCommand.Executed (to be coherent with CommandBinding)
- Perspective application :
Now displays a warning when no module is loaded (i.e. for security reasons)
Has a new background color
Perspective.Model.MainModel renamed as Perspective.Model.ExtensionModel

What's new since version 1.0 and 2.0 beta :
- .NET 4.0 support (but Perspective 2.0 is not fully compatible with previous .NET versions),
- BREAKING CHANGE : Namespace change from Perspective.Core.Primitives to Perspective.Core.Wpf : AxisDirection, Helper3D.

Perspective.Core
----------------
EventArgs<T> : A generic class to manage an event argument with one parameter.
CancelEventArgs<T> : A generic class to manage a CancelEventArgs argument with one parameter.

Perspective.Core.Wpf
--------------------
AnimationHelper's namespace has moved from Perspective.Core.Wpf to Perspective.Core.Wpf.Animation
GeometryHelper : a new helper class with static methods : DegreeToRadian, RadianToDegree, GetRotationMatrix, GetTranslationMatrix, GetScaleMatrix, GetSkewMatrix and RotatePoint
DPHelper : An helper class for dependency properties, with static functions to validate values.
RenderingHelper : new property IsHWAccelerationDisabled, which enables to turn off hardware acceleration for debugging and test purposes.
Helper3D : static methods DegreeToRadian and RadianToDegree are now deprecated, new methods GetScaleMatrix, GetTranslationMatrix, GetXRotationMatrix, GetYRotationMatrix, GetZRotationMatrix.

Perspective.Core.Wpf.Data
-------------------------
SignalCommand : A Command implementation for the MVVM pattern using events (inspired by Josh Smith work about RelayCommand and MVVM).

Perspective.Wpf.Panels
------------------------
BeePanel : a honeycomb layout wrap panel.
BeeGrid : a honeycomb layout grid panel.

Perspective.Wpf.ResourceStrings
-------------------------------
ResourceStringManager : A class to load string resources by code.

Perspective.Wpf.Shapes
------------------------
RegularPolygon : draws a regular polygon.
Star : draws a n-branch star.
Arrow : draws an arrow.

Perspective.Wpf.Controls
------------------------
Workshop3D : new property ShowCommandPanel
Checkerboard : a new class to display a checkerboard

Perspective.Wpf3D
-----------------
RelativeTransformer : a new class to manage by code the transformations and the current position of a Visual3D. 
The successive transformation operations (translation, scaling or rotation) are cumulative 
(the last one is relative to its previous one).

Perspective.Wpf3D.Shapes
------------------------
XyzAxis3D : new property CoordinateSystemKind (to display right-handed or left-handed coordinate systems)

Perspective application project
-------------------------------
A new WPF 4 application which can dynamically load pages from extension assemblies using MEF. 
This application is used here as demo of Perspective library.
The background image is loaded randomly from a PerspectiveAlbum subdirectory in the application directory or in the system Images directories.

Perspective.Hosting
-------------------
A new .NET 4 project to manage MEF parts of the Perspective application project. 
The classes are used by the entension assemblies.
Extension : Represents an extension for the Perspective.exe application.
PageInfo : Represents the metadata associated with a WPF page of an extension assembly.

Perspective.Config
------------------
An extension assembly to manage the skins and cultures for the Perspective application.
View/SkinDemo : a new page to change the current skin
SkinManager : now handles a CurrentSkin property

PerspectiveDemo.Wpf
-------------------
An extension assembly which is a demo of WPF 2D Perspective library features.
View/DpiScalingDemo : fixed a bug (a change to the diagonal size TextBox now persists between sessions, with a scope for the Perspective.Core assembly, when the bSaveScale button is clicked)

PerspectiveDemo.Wpf3D
---------------------
An extension assembly which is a demo of WPF 3D Perspective library features.
